We convert the .docx files to github markdown for easier viewing for users without a .docx viewer. The is done with the pandoc tool (1.13.0+) from https://github.com/jgm/pandoc. In order to avoid the licensing issues with this package, we are making this an optional part of the build. If you want to modify the source .docx files, you should get the pandoc tool and place it in this directory.
